# The Coffee Shop

## The project

This is a small project that i made using HTML, CSS and Javascript, i also used webpack and npm. In this project i made a restaurant page with a navbar with 3 sections, the Home, Menu and Contact, i added every html element on the page with javascript and DOM manipulation.

## What i learned

Doing this project i learned to use a lot of useful things, i divided my project into modules, each section of my page was a module, and i learned how to put it all together with webpack, importing and exporting the modules to get everything working, webpack is an amazing tool and really makes the development process easier. I also got a very good grasp on DOM manipulation and used a lot of CSS in this project.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed doing this project, i learned very useful tools and features and the process of developing the project was very satisfying for me, i got stuck in some parts but after some thinking and searching i've managed to find the solutions, now that i have finished i feel very satisfied with the result.
